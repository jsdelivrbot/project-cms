# Media Apps

How much is it a regular app vs a new interface?

Need an interface for displaying an integrated list (display all media sources)

## Links

Store basic links to external resources

No editing functionality, add/remove only

## Images

Store images; crop & thumbnail

Need to be able to create named variations (eg blog_thubmnail) with custom cropping


# Single table

single table design would break current app loading procedures but would allow for performant blending of list results
This approach is favored for media interface

Alternatively the media apps can just emit actions for the media baseUrl to store at that level and treat its own url for settings
